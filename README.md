# ctci-java
Solutions to questions from "Cracking the Coding Interview" (6th edition), written in Java (for learning purposes).
Assumptions are documented in the comments.
Each solution has a unit test.
Some edge cases (especially user input errors) are untested because their behaviour is undefined.
